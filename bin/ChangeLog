	* AssembleReferenceHistos.cpp: Completely revised all the logic to
	compute the reference ROOT file. It gives a significant gain in
	speed: the current limiting factor is still file access on Castor,
	in case the original ROOT file is on tape. The new logic uses the
	new DQMStore feature to select ME based on Perl re.

	* AssembleReferenceHistos.cpp (main): fixed a problem in deleting non-matching MEs from the main
	source file(s). The new methods that is called is DQMStore.removeElement(std::string path, std::string name),
	where path and name are extracted directly from the ME to be deleted.
	Tested on 3_5_0, it should work on higher releases transparently.
